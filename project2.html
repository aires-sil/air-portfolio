      <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.</p>

      <!-- Project Summary -->
      <h3>Project Summary -AI made</h3>
      <p>
         I built my personal portfolio website starting from an AI-generated template, 
         improving it into a clean, readable, and professional site. I structured the HTML and separated 
         CSS into its own file for maintainability, experimented with layout and color schemes, and 
         added navigation, redirects, and a “Back to Top” button. Along the way, I refined sections like 
         About Me, Skills, and Contact, organized assets for future use, and published the project on 
         GitHub under the MIT License. This project was completed without prior HTML experience and provided 
         hands on learning in web development, code organization, and deployment.

      <!-- Timeline -->
      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>
         <strong>Hour 0-1:</strong> Started with an AI generated barebones template. Using Notepad, I 
         experimented with HTML and CSS to see how changes affected the site. Explored the code and 
         structure to understand what each section did.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Hour 1-3:</strong> Attempted to improve the code indentation manually, instead 
         decided to use AI to properly format the code. Chose and applied a colour scheme. Labeled 
         each section of the website and had AI double check the labeling. Fixed the contact section 
         and filled in the skills section with acurate information. Added a proper "About Me" section 
         and labeled the header with my skills,name and title.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Hour 3-6:</strong> Learned to create linkes and redirects between pages using href, 
         applying AI guidance to make navigation look proffessional. Created a GitHub account, created a 
         repository, experimented and manage it until a satisfactory level of organization was reached. 
         Moved the CSS to a separate file (style.css) for easier editing and reuse accross multiple 
         project pages. Added a Back To Top button using header ID top and styled it for visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Hour 6-9:</strong> Refined long paragraphs for readability. With AI assistance, fixed scaling 
         issues to ensure the site displayed properly on small and large screens. (With AI guidance.) Added 
         comments to Highlight sections needing improvement. Created an assets folder for images/fonts and a 
         templates folder for future expansions or reuse. Released the project under the MIT license. I decided 
         to host the portfolio via Netlfiy for thier easy hosting with robust uptime. Easy to connect to Github, 
         automatically updating the site whenever I push changes to my repo and free SSL certifactes for security.</p>
