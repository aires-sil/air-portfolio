      <h2>Pi Server Home Lab</h2>

      <!-- Warning -->  
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.
       See the summary of services below. Any info that may harm security has been 
       removed.</p>

      
    <p>
        This server was developed with the assistance of Chat GPT to help write scripts and execute commands. 
        Most of the setup was completed via SSH on a Windows 11 PC. I reviewed each script to understand its function, 
        planned the server layout, and worked through any issues that arose. I chose the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB despite its high price due 
        to its power efficiency and compact form factor. The most challenging part was getting the NVMe drive recognized by the OS and 
        resolving compatibility issues with the NVMe setup.
    </p>


      <h3>Ai Summary -NotebookLM</h3>
      <p>
        The Pi Server Home Lab is an ongoing, power-efficient home server project built on a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB 
        to host a variety of versatile services, utilizing a hardware stack costing approximately £134 to £145. 
        The server infrastructure, running Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64bit, was strategically designed to maximize component 
        longevity by operating the OS from a USB stick while dedicating the 256GB NVME SSD for logs, cache, and other data. 
        Core services, mostly managed via Docker containers, include a Jellyfin media server, a Minecraft Bedrock server, 
        and a Tiny Llama AI chat-bot, which was optimized using LLama.cpp for 4bit quantization to remain within strict RAM 
        limits. Security and infrastructure management are handled through a Wireguard VPN for secure external access, Caddy 
        as a reverse proxy ensuring HTTPS for services, and automated maintenance via Watchtower and custom scripts. The 
        project involved extensive problem-solving over approximately 54 hours of setup, including integrating AI tools like 
        Chat GPT to assist with coding and script execution.

      <h3>Physical setup</h3>
      <p>
        Took ~1hr; had some trouble applying the thermal pads as they kept falling off. 
        The case design meant the ribbon cable was upside down, so I used the NVMe standoffs 
        to hold the drive inverted above the stand.

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Hour 0-40:</strong>Trial and error, fix NVME not being recognised, decide on 
        to use raspberry pi OS lite 64bit Unable to figure out how to get the OS to stop 
        breaking and refusing to SSH. I decided to instead have the OS on the USB stick and 
        the NVME for everything else including cache and  logs to drastically increase the 
        USB's lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hour 40-54:</strong>Installed pi OS lite 64bit on USB and moved as much of the 
        OS to the NVME to ensure the least amount of wear on the USB. Added automated 
        maintenance scripts to monitor wear on USB and NVME and so I don't have to manually 
        update my services, auto USB backups at Off Peak times, added 1GB swap to NVME with 
        very low swap to ensure that the pi server doesn't just crash when under extremely 
        heavy loads. Setup Docker, Wireguard VPN (PiVPN) and Samba.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hour 54+:</strong>Built an AI with web access, password protected, Processing 
        films for Jellyfin on a windows pc via FFMPEG (scripts optimized for Nvidia GPUS with 
        support for NVENC + Vulkan for best efficiency). Optimized the maintenance scripts to 
        not overlap and cause crashes or corruption of the Pi server. Surprisingly discovered 
        the USB stick that I found was from 2013 and still had no bad blocks or issues and was 
        basically brand new condition.
      </p>

      <h3>Services -Explaination</h3>
      <p id="jellyfin">
        <strong>Jellyfin (Media server):</strong> Media server for films, enabling easier access abroad. I added 
        multiple plugins for metadata, subtitles, and automatic stopping of transcoding once a session ends, 
        improving usability and performance. The server uses <a href="#ddns" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><strong>no-IP DDNS</strong></a> for reliable stability 
        and uptime. It runs in a Docker container, making updates automated through <a href="#watchtower" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><strong>Watchtower</strong></a>.
        The scripts used for encoding and replacing audio are stored in <a href="https://github.com/aires-sil/air-portfolio/tree/d4ad6c616146a0269759a619271dfde5648e2f90/assets/project1/files/jellyfin" style="text-decoration: none; color: #003333;">
        github</a>.
        Added live TV access for Jellyfin with free <a href="https://github.com/LITUATUI/M3UPT/tree/5ef3eedc84762a4bd4e16dc149fea1a114f7ef92" style="text-decoration: none; color: #003333;">
        Portuguese channels</a> via M3U Tuner, along with a few other free channels. <em>Note: Live channels are currently under maintenance.</em>
      </p>
        <p id="minecraft-bedrock-server">
        <strong>Minecraft Bedrock server:</strong>Deployed a self-managed Minecraft Bedrock 
        server using Docker for easy updates and container isolation. Implemented automated 
        daily backups to ensure data integrity, and configured resource limits to maintain 
        stability under load. The server uses NO-IP DDNS for reliable external access.
      </p>
        <p id="ai">
        <strong>AI Chatbot (Docker + LLaMA.cpp):</strong>Developed a custom AI chatbot using Chat GPT 
        for scripting and a custom API for web UI communication. Implemented a 
        secret key and password protection, and deployed behind a Caddy reverse 
        proxy with GZIP for secure HTTPS access. The model used was tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v0.3.Q4_K_M.gguf 
        with 4-bit quantization to stay within memory limits. The scripts and code are stored in 
        <a href="https://github.com/aires-sil/air-portfolio/tree/d4ad6c616146a0269759a619271dfde5648e2f90/assets/project1/files/pi-ai" style="text-decoration: none; color: #003333;">
        github</a>. <strong>This service has been archived as a learning project.</strong>
      </p>
        <p id="heimdall">
        <strong>Heimdall (Web UI Dashboard):</strong>Application dashboard designed to organize, group 
        and provide quick access to web applications and services from a single UI. I've chosen not to 
        add SSO since I use Bitwarden and it would add unnecessary complications and potential 
        security risks, knowing my luck. It runs a Docker container. It acts like a gateway to the 
        rest of my applications for managing the Pi server and its services.
      </p>
        <p id="portainer">
        <strong>Portainer (Container Management):</strong>Used to manage and monitor containers on the server, allowing me to restart, 
        shutdown, or delete old images and containers. Its simple web UI helps keep the server organized. 
        I made the mistake of creating the full stack before setting up Portainer, so I cannot manage the 
        stack as a whole or edit it, and I lost the original .YML file. It has not been recreated yet and 
        likely will not be for some time, as doing so could break the containers.
      </p>
        <p id="watchtower">
        <strong>Watchtower (Auto Updates):</strong>A Docker container that 
        automates maintenance by stopping containers, pulling updated images, removing old images, and 
        restarting containers whenever a new version is available. This ensures my server stays up-to-date 
        with minimal manual intervention.
      </p>
        <p id="caddy">
        <strong>Caddy (Reverse Proxy with HTTPS):</strong>Handles HTTPS access for my Jellyfin media server, 
        <a href="https://itstudy.duckdns.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;  color: #003333;">Troll site</a>, 
        AI chatbot, and this portfolio site, as well as any future services. 
        It ensures secure connections and simplifies management of multiple web services.
      </p>
        <p id="netdata">
        <strong>Netdata (Monitoring):</strong>Monitors system resource usage to ensure efficient operation. 
        It provides detailed metrics on CPU, RAM, and container usage, helping to identify and prevent 
        resource bottlenecks.
      </p>
        <p id="samba">
        <strong>Samba (File Sharing):</strong>I chose Samba for its 
        lightweight and easy-to-use setup. An additional layer of security requires a username and password, 
        protecting the home network from unauthorized access. It is used for transferring files from my PC, 
        editing Docker container configurations, and updating hosted webpages, including the AI web UI.
      </p>
        <p id="wireguard">
        <strong>Wireguard VPN:</strong>I set up a Wireguard VPN using PiVPN for easier initial configuration and ongoing management. 
        UDP port 51820 was port-forwarded to allow external access, and a DDNS service was used on the endpoint to handle dynamic public IPs. 
        This setup provides secure home access to services that do not have dedicated DDNS or port forwarding configured.
      </p>
        <p id="ddns">
        <strong>DDNS (DuckDNS + NoIP):</strong>I use DuckDNS for non-essential services such as my 
        troll site and portfolio site, with a script that checks every 5 minutes for changes to my 
        public IP. For essential services like Wireguard, as well as Jellyfin and the Minecraft 
        Bedrock server, I use NO-IP. I chose NO-IP for its robust performance, reliability, and 
        anycast network. The only limitation is that the free tier provides one hostname, but 
        additional hostnames are inexpensive (£2.99/month for 3) and fully support automated dynamic updates.
